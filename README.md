# Zsh Repository Tool (zrep)

zrep is a powerful and user-friendly package manager for the Zsh shell. It allows you to easily install, manage, and share Zsh packages, such as plugins, themes, and scripts, directly from a central repository.

## What is it?

`zrep` in and of itself is the command line tool that you use to install and manage scripts that are placed in `$fpath` used by Zsh. The packages are available on [the zrep website](https://zrep.kekepower.com) where you can, if you want to share your own scripts, register for an account. By sharing your scripts with the community, you are probably making somebody's day easier.
